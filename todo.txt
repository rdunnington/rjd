todo:
* rjd_resource: move to a different repo - this is more of an engine feature than a framework thing
* rjd_resource: register fallback resources for certain types
* rjd_resource: have the loader implement a reload notification interface and have rjd_resource_lib poll to perform reloads
* rjd.h: remove and use normal heirarchical #include structure?
* rjd_cmd: no allocations and instead statically configurable
* rjd_mem: option to passthrough linear allocations to heap (can help debug corruption)
* rjd_binrw: swap on big-endianness
